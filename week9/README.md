## presentations
next week for paper presentation

## Live Session

### Network Interface

- routing
  - which of of the possible paths are allowed for packets
- arbitration
  - when are paths available for packets
- switching
  - how are paths allocated to packets

### Shared-media networks

avoid collisions because bus is a shared resource
- CSMA/CD
  - carrier sensing multi access (with collision detection)
